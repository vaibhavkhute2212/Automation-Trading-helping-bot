This project works on Algorithmic Trading which uses computer programs and technical indicators to make a wise ‘trade call’. Intra-Day Trading involves purchasing and selling stocks in a single day. In the case of day trading, individuals hold stocks for a few minutes or hours. A trader involved in such trade needs to close his/her transactions prior to the day’s market closure. It is popular for capitalising on small-scale fluctuations in NAV of stocks. Intraday trading requires proficiency in market matters, a thorough understanding of market volatility, and keen sense regarding the up and down in stock values. Therefore, it is performed mostly by experienced investors or traders. 
We have optimized the values of the parameters of all technical indicators that we have used in our project. And on the basis of that we have developed a buy or sell signal and live chart analysis. This will facilitate user to make an informed decision about placing a particular trade or not. Through our extensive research and optimization algorithms, we have optimized the parameters of all technical indicators that we have used.
